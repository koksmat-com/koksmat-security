# Koksmat Security

Welcome to the **Koksmat Security** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive collection of tools, scripts, and automation workflows to help organizations ensure they follow the best security practices across their development and operational environments.

---

## **Ambition**

The goal of **Koksmat Security** is to simplify and automate the implementation of security best practices for both developers and system administrators. By centralizing tools and scripts in one repository, we aim to:

- **Ensure Compliance**: Help teams align with industry-standard security guidelines.
- **Automate Security Checks**: Provide workflows to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities proactively.
- **Educate and Empower**: Offer easy-to-use resources for maintaining secure environments.
- **Standardize Practices**: Establish repeatable, auditable processes for security across all projects.

---

## **Features**

### **1. Security Tools**

A curated set of tools for various security tasks:

- Secret scanning (e.g., GitLeaks, TruffleHog)
- Vulnerability analysis (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Snyk)
- Dependency management (e.g., npm audit, pip-audit)

### **2. Automation Scripts**

Scripts to automate security tasks, including:

- Repository scanning for sensitive information.
- Automated fixes for common vulnerabilities.
- CI/CD pipeline integrations for real-time checks.

### **3. Best Practice Templates**

Pre-configured templates for:

- GitHub Actions workflows (e.g., secret scanning, dependency checks).
- Configuration files for popular security tools.
- Infrastructure-as-code security policies.

### **4. Reports and Dashboards**

Generate reports to track and visualize:

- Scanned repositories and findings.
- Compliance with organizational policies.
- Trends in fixing vulnerabilities over time.
